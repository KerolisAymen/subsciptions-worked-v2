# Frontend Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. Run the `frontend-fix.bat` script from the root directory:
   ```
   .\frontend-fix.bat
   ```

2. The script will:
   - Check for Node.js installation
   - Install dependencies
   - Check for common issues
   - Verify Azure configurations

3. After running the script, try starting your frontend application again.

4. If you still encounter issues, check:
   - Browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Network requests in browser developer tools
   - Azure portal for service health if using Azure resources

## Common Terminal Errors

If you're seeing terminal errors, they might be related to:

1. Missing dependencies - run `npm install`
2. Port conflicts - check if another application is using the same port
3. Environment variables - verify your `.env` file has the correct settings
4. Node.js version incompatibility - ensure you're using a compatible version
